      But remember this is a side-project and maybe can reach the limit of requests.

      Ok, but what I do? For now you can use the services:
      - <b>Tone Analyzer</b> to use send me something like: \`/tone Product sales have been disappointing for the past three quarters.\`
      - <b>Text to Speech</b> to use send me something like: \`/text_to_speech Product sales\`
      - <b>Visual Recognition</b> to use send me a photo`,
    { parse_mode: 'HTML' },
  );
});
